His paintings reflect the old ways of his people (The 'Dine’) with modern and abstract symbolism mixed in to portray how he and his people live in two worlds: one on the reservation, the other in a fast moving and modern society.

Benton is currently teaching and using art to help Native Americans in recovery while pursing a studio of his own.
